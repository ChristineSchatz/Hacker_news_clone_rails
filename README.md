##Hacker News Clone

This app is a simplified, "junior" version of Hacker News built with Ruby on Rails. Users can post new articles with a title and a URL. Creating, deleting and updating articles requires a logged in user. Posting comments also requires logging in. Enjoy!

This is a solo project.
